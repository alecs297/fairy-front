# fairy-front

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

Fairy is a basic bill management system designed to help with your groups' spendings, build with Angular, express and mongoDB.

## Client (angular)

The frontend can be served via either http or https. The SSL configuration requires `private.pem` and `public.pem` to be present in the `keys` directory.

The `environments/environment.ts` file allows tweaking of the back-end endpoint URL.

Tailwind classes will be automatically generated.

# start with http
npm run start

# start with https
npm run start-ssl
```
